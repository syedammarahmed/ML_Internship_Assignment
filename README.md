This project aims to predict user churn for an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques. By analyzing user activity data (view, cart, purchase events), the project identifies at-risk users and provides actionable insights to improve user retention.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into user behavior, event trends, and product popularity.
Feature Engineering: Creation of RFM metrics, behavior patterns, and session-based features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Churn Prediction Model: Trained a model (XGBoost) to classify users based on churn likelihood with evaluation metrics like AUC and F1-score.
Actionable Recommendations: Insights to guide business strategies, such as personalized campaigns and product improvements.
